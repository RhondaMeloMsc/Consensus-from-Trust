/// This is one reason why it may not have worked

This is a classic and very tricky error!

The message Killed means your code didn't crash with a Java error; it was forcefully terminated by the grader's operating system.

This almost always happens for one of two reasons:

Timeout: Your code took too long to run.

Out of Memory (OOM): Your code used up all the available RAM.

Based on the simple "gossip" strategy from the last solution, the problem is definitely Out of Memory.

The Problem in the Old Code
The old code's strategy was:

Keep one master list of all transactions ever seen (myProposedTxs).

In receiveFromFollowees, add all new transactions to this master list.

In sendToFollowers, send this entire master list.

Here's why it fails:

Round 1: You send your 10 transactions.

Round 2: You receive 90 new txs from your followers. Your master list is now 100. You send all 100.

Round 3: You receive 500 new txs. Your master list is 600. You send all 600.

Round 4: You receive 1000 new txs. Your master list is 1600. You send all 1600.

In a large simulation, every single node ends up broadcasting its entire history every round. The memory use explodes, and the OS kills your program.

The Solution: Be an Efficient Gossiper
The fix is simple: only gossip about new transactions.

Keep the masterTxSet (all txs you've ever seen).

Keep a second, temporary set, like txsToBroadcast.

When you receive transactions, check if they are truly new (not in your masterTxSet).

If a transaction is new, add it to both your masterTxSet and your temporary txsToBroadcast set.

When you send, send only the temporary txsToBroadcast set. After sending, clear it.

This way, you're only ever broadcasting the new information you learned in the last round, not your entire history. This keeps memory use low.
