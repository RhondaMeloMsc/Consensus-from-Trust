STILL AN ISSUE!!!!!!!


That "Killed" error isn't a compilation error; it's a runtime error from the grading script. It means your code was forcibly terminated by the operating system, which almost always happens for one of two reasons in a coding assignment:
	1	Out of Memory: Your code used too much RAM.
	2	Timeout: Your code took too long to run.
The problem is the "never forget" strategy combined with sendToFollowers(). Your previous code was sending its entire list of known transactions in every single round. As the knownTransactions set grows, copying it and sending it 100 times per round consumes a massive amount of memory and CPU, leading to the "Killed" error.
The assignment sheet provides a crucial hint: "REMEMBER: After final round, behavior of getProposals [sendToFollowers] changes and it should return the transactions upon which consensus has been reached" . This implies that during the rounds, it should do something different (and more efficient).




The Solution: "Gossip What's New"

The correct, efficient strategy is to only broadcast the transactions you just learned in the previous round. You still remember everything, but you only tell your followers about the new things.
Here is the efficient implementation that will pass:
	•	It maintains allKnownTransactions for the final consensus.
	•	It uses a new set, newTransactionsToBroadcast, to hold only what was learned in the last round.
	•	It checks the currentRound to know when to switch from "gossip new" to "report all" .

/**
 * This compliant node implements a "gossip what's new" strategy
 * to avoid "Killed" errors from resource exhaustion.
 *
 * 1. It maintains a master set 'allKnownTransactions' for the final consensus.
 * 2. It maintains a temporary set 'newTransactionsToBroadcast' for what to
 * send in the *next* round. This is much smaller and more efficient.
 * 3. It switches behavior for the final call to sendToFollowers()
 * to return the complete consensus set, as hinted in the spec .
